## What the hell is Chain reaction all about?
Great question. There are a bunch of little balls bouncing around and you have **ONE** manual explosion you can create. If a ball hit that explosion, it will then explode and on and on until there are no more explosions. Your goal is to get the minimum required to explode on each level to go on to the next.

## Do I win a prize?
Another great question. Just pure pride and satisfaction at the moment.
